<h2>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>
    
    <p>First Impressions:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>I'm glad my professors have good sense and good humor.</li>
        <li>These things seem obvious.</li>
        <li>It is very encouraging to discover that other people think philosophically about maps, and even more so to find that we agree.</li> 
        <li>The New Jerusalem mataphor draws some interesting parallels to Jesus' appearing not as the "expected" Messiah, much the way technological impact is transforming the nature of modern mapping in unexpected ways. </li>
        <li>Why are there typos? </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Additional Thoughts:</p>
    
    <p>The Floating Sheep Manifesto is an excellent (and pleasantly humourous) summation of modern-day cartography, especially regarding its contradictions, social implications, and pressing needs. I enjoy the New Jerusalem comparison, particularly because it parallels well my own beliefs about why Jesus was not the Messiah the Jewish nation was expecting and why the typical, evangelical protestant American idea of 'Heaven' is inconsistent with the Biblical narrative. That, however, is an essay for another day. Or maybe later today, but definitely after this assignment. </p> 
 
    <p>Stylistically, I appreciate how accesibly academic ideas about mapping are presented. The essay is understandable, informative, and more enjoyable than a typical academic read. Initially the step "-read the Floating Sheep Manifesto" appeared to be a funny suggestion slipped in for kicks and giggles, but I'm glad it wasn't. One of my main frustrations as an undergrad in Geography was that mapping was not presented in a manner that balanced the reality of influence and art in modern maps with the technical, practical aspects. The emphasis of my undergrad program was primarily Point #4: "Pretty maps are better than ugly maps, but ugly maps will do in a pinch." This was then reinforced by a job with the Federal Government (but more accurately might be presented as "Taxpayers don't pay us to make pretty maps, so just make the functional ones and then stop.") There was virtually no philosophical emphasis, or discussion, or in-person collaboration for that mattter. I found this very disappointing at the time.</p>
        
    <p>I feel affirmed in my decision to join the New Maps Plus program after reading the Manifesto. The points made by the Sheep Floaters summarize many of my own observations, and highlight the fact that the people in charge of NMP are: </p>
    
    <ol type="a">
        <li>paying attention </li>
        <li>excellent thinkers </li>
        <li>participators in academia, and</li>
        <li>very proficient map nerds;</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p> which, as a student, means they are exactly the type of people I want to learn from, and that they are teaching precisely what I have been wanting to learn. This has not happened for me since my 10th grade Photoshop class. It's very exciting. Most importantly, the program is relationally-based (specifically people relationships) which is further demonstrated by the seemingly bizzare collective of Sheep Floaters. As someone who aspires to be a modern cartographer with an effective coding skillset, I feel as though I may have found my tribe.</p>
        
    <p>There is a clear emphasis within the Manifesto  on Power, and maps' relationship(s) to it. As a reader, I did not find the term adequately defined. While this is probably the result of a more practical reason (the Sheep Floaters have hotly debated the true meaning of 'power' on their favored porch and not come to an agreement, for instance), it seems like an oversight. Particularly in the context of a Manifesto, the underlying assumptions of the authors remain vague. What is meant by "power"? At what point does a map move from being merely influential to being powerful? How does context affect a map's inherent power? Can maps have inherent power? Is there a hierarchy mappers can follow to prioritize which maps are potentially more "powerful" than others? And if so, who should learn it? These are all questions I find myself wondering. Maybe there will be a sequel. </p>
