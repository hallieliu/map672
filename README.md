## My Learning Objectives
I hope to gain:

- the ability to use html and css to create web pages;
- an understanding of how html, css, js can be used to make maps;
- familiarity with Git and an understanding of how GitHub can be useful for making/collaborating on maps;
- a functional web portfolio for my maps! Yay.
